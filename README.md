## The Game

It's just telephone pictionary.

1. Get a bunch of friends (make some friends if you don't have any). Recommended 7+, though 5 can work.
2. Wait for everyone to join the same lobby, then start the game.
3. Pick a word or phrase.
4. Try your best to draw the word or phrase your friend wrote. Don't just write the words down.
5. Guess what your friend tried to draw.
6. Repeat drawing and guessing until you've drawn or guessed everybody else's words.
7. Once the game is done, you can see what became of your word or phrase. You can also look at everybody else's chains, and see how far off your guesses were.

## The Name
